        Image Compression (Conversion Png-JPG) works flawlessly now
        Compression of Folder into .cbz works

        /*
        Image Compression, in function followed with Compression, but first of all Extraction is needed
        Compression of a nested Folder (in case of poor prior Archives)
         */
        //To be done:
        /*
        Extraction function halfway (now just need to get the content of files)
        Completed System
        .jar arguments, to define the baseFolders, without recompiling
